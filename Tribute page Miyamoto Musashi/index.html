				<h2 class="header2 text-right">Philosophy...</h2>
				<p class="text-justify info-right">In Musashi's last book, The Book of Five Rings, Musashi seems to take a&nbspvery philosophical approach to looking at the "craft of war":
					<blockquote>"There are five ways in which men pass through life: as gentlemen, warriors, farmers, artisans and merchants."</blockquote>
				</p>
				<p class="text-justify info-right">
					Throughout the book, he implies that the way of the Warrior, as well as the meaning of a <em>"true strategist"</em> is that of somebody who has made mastery of many art forms away from that of the sword, such as tea drinking (sado), laboring, writing,
					and painting, as Musashi practiced throughout his life. Musashi was hailed as an extraordinary sumi-e artist in the use of ink monochrome as depicted in two such paintings: <em>"Shrike Perched in a Dead Tree"</em> (Koboku Meigekizu) and <em>"Wild Geese Among Reeds"</em>					(Rozanzu). Going back to the Book of Five Rings, Musashi talks deeply about the ways of Buddhism.</p>
